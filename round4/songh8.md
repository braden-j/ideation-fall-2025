## 1. What I Explored Today

_List the projects you seriously considered. Keep it brief._

| Project Name | Source | Key Takeaway (1 sentence) |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------|
| CrowdScout   |   R1   | Interesting idea but requires large-scale data and is not feasible within the course timeline. |
| GroupMeet    |  Instructor | Clear scope, practical design, and realistically shippable in a semester. |
| CrowdQA      | Instructor | Too simple and may not meaningfully demonstrate core crowdsourcing concepts. |

**Resources I used**:
- [x] Rubric scoring (RUBRIC-PROJECT-VIABILITY.md)
- [x] V2 detailed analyses (reports/v2-analyses/)
- [ ] Steelman Analysis pathways (STEELMAN-ANALYSIS.md)
- [x] Group discussions
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 2. My Decision

**Project Name**: GatherMessageAI

**Decision type**:
- [x] STAYING with Round 3 project (same approach)
- [ ] STAYING with Round 3 project (modified approach/scope)
- [ ] PIVOTING to different project
- [ ] JOINING another team's project

**If pivoting or adopting someone's idea**:
- Original author (if applicable): [Name/PennKey]
- Original round: [R1 / R2 / R3 / Instructor idea]

## 3. Why This Decision

**High-level reasoning** (2-3 paragraphs):

I chose this project because it directly solves a real coordination problem that I personally experience in multiple Penn group chats. People frequently say “let’s meet” or “let’s do something,” but nothing happens because availability is unclear, group decision-making is slow, and conversations quickly become overwhelming. This project offers a structured way to collect availability and preferences while staying inside the environment where planning already happens. Compared to the ideas I explored in earlier rounds, this one is far more feasible and testable within the project timeline.

I also chose this project because it provides a meaningful opportunity to apply core crowdsourcing concepts while still producing something people would actually use. Unlike ideas such as CrowdScout that require significant data collection and scaling, GatherMessageAI can be validated quickly because the crowd naturally exists within the group chat. This makes the project both achievable and impactful.

**What convinced me**:
- Feasibility  
- Usefulness  
- Natural user base  

**What concerns me** (and how I'll address it):
- Low response participation → use simple follow-up reminders  
- Too many notifications → allow adjustable frequency for prompts

## 4. What I'm Building

**One-sentence project description**:  
An AI assistant embedded in group chats to structure decision-making through quick polls and crowdsourcing the optimal group choice.

**MVP Scope** (3-4 core features only):

1. Simple interaction prompts  
2. Quick availability poll  
3. Consensus suggestion  
4. Summary message  

**What I'm explicitly NOT building**:
- Passive NLP monitoring  
- Full recommendation engine

## 5. Week 1 Validation

**The specific test I'll run Week 1**:

- **Where**: A Penn club group chat  
- **When**: Tuesday afternoon  
- **What**: I will manually simulate a structured poll message to observe how responses are collected  
- **Success metric**: Percentage of members who respond and clarity of their responses

**If Week 1 test fails, I will**:
- [x] Pivot to: Using a simpler Google Form or basic structured poll  
- [ ] Use MTurk/paid participants  
- [ ] Try different recruitment channel: [specify]  
- [ ] Simplify the task to: [easier version]  
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 6. **Tentative** Team (Optional, Only If You Already Have An Idea)

At this stage, you are not expected to have formed teams, however if you already have an idea of who you intend to work with, you may indicate it here.

**Team members**:

1. Yuxuan Tian (ytian27) - Backend Dev  
2. Hugo Song (songh8) - Frontend Dev  
3. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_  
4. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_  

**Team status**:
- [x] Same team from Round 3  
- [ ] New team formed during Round 4  
- [ ] Solo (will find teammates later)  
- [ ] Joining an existing team  

---

## 7. Reflection

**Most valuable part of Round 4**:  
Realizing that feasibility matters, and that using an existing group chat as the natural crowd drastically reduces testing effort and complexity.

**Biggest surprise**:  
Plans often fail not because people are uninterested but because the process of coordinating availability and reaching consensus is full of friction.

**One thing I'd tell future students about Round 4**:  
Choose a problem you personally face, because testing and refining the idea becomes significantly easier.

## Commitment

**I commit to**:
- [x] Building the MVP scope above (3-4 features maximum)  
- [x] Running a concrete Week 1 validation test  
- [x] Pivoting if Week 1 shows <20% success  
- [x] Meeting with instructor if I hit major blockers
