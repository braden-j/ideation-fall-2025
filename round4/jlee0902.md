## 1. What I Explored Today

_List the projects you seriously considered. Keep it brief._

| Project Name | Source | Key Takeaway (1 sentence) |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------|
| CampusEats  | Round 3 | Learned that food-related tools get strong student engagement but rely heavily on consistent data collection. |
| LocalPulse  | Instructor | A hyper-localized map of ongoing micro-events, but requires high initial participation to feel alive. |
| StudySphere  | R2 Drop | Has clear usefulness but overlaps with existing scheduling tools, making differentiation hard. |

**Resources I used**:
- [X] Rubric scoring (RUBRIC-PROJECT-VIABILITY.md)
- [ ] V2 detailed analyses (reports/v2-analyses/)
- [X] Steelman Analysis pathways (STEELMAN-ANALYSIS.md)
- [X] Group discussions
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 2. My Decision

**Project Name**: LocalPulse

**Decision type**:
- [ ] STAYING with Round 3 project (same approach)
- [ ] STAYING with Round 3 project (modified approach/scope)
- [X] PIVOTING to different project
- [ ] JOINING another team's project

**If pivoting or adopting someone's idea**:
- Original author (if applicable): [Name/PennKey]
- Original round: [R1 / R2 / R3 / Instructor idea]

## 3. Why This Decision

**High-level reasoning** (2-3 paragraphs):

Across the ideas I considered, I realized I was most drawn to projects that help people navigate everyday uncertainty. CampusEats was fun, but heavily dependent on pulling accurate menus and food availability, which can be unstable. StudySphere had promise but didn’t feel fundamentally different from tools students already rely on. LocalPulse, though risky because of the cold-start problem, solves a real issue I’ve experienced: not knowing what’s happening around campus until after events are over.

LocalPulse stood out because it creates immediate value once even a small number of posts exist. The hyper-local focus gives it a clear initial scope, while leaving room to expand later. It also aligns well with my technical skills and the kind of product I’d actually want to use—something light, real-time, and community-driven.

**What convinced me**:
- Early prototype could be built quickly with minimal backend complexity.
- Students often complain about missing events; the problem is real and shared.
- Crowdsourcing works well in dense environments like campus.

**What concerns me** (and how I'll address it):
- Cold-start risk → Seed the map manually with 30–40 events from club calendars during Week 1.
- Quality control → Lightweight verification (2–3 confirmations) before events appear publicly.

## 4. What I'm Building

**One-sentence project description**:
A real-time, crowdsourced map that helps students discover small-scale events and activities happening around campus.

**MVP Scope** (3-4 core features only):

1. **Event Submission**: Users can add simple event listings with time, location, and brief description.
2. **Map View**: Interactive map showing all nearby events as pins with category filters.
3. **Verification**: Events require at least two confirmations before going public.
4. **Auto-Expiration** (optional): Events automatically disappear after they end.

**What I'm explicitly NOT building** (to keep scope realistic):
- Notification system or reminders.
- City-wide scaling or multi-campus support.
- Recommendation algorithms.

## 5. Week 1 Validation

**The specific test I'll run Week 1**:

- **Where**: r/UPenn, Penn Clubs Slack channels, and two large GroupMe chats.  
- **When**: Monday of Week 1 at 9:30am.  
- **What**: Share a lightweight prototype and ask students to submit one event they know about that week.  
- **Success metric**: 20+ unique event submissions and at least 40 users opening the map within 48 hours.

**If Week 1 test fails, I will**:
- [X] Pivot to: curated version where events are manually aggregated by the team.
- [ ] Use MTurk/paid participants
- [X] Try different recruitment channel: more class Slacks and student org email lists  
- [ ] Simplify the task to: [easier version]
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 6. **Tentative** Team (Optional, Only If You Already Have An Idea)

At this stage, you are not expected to have formed teams, however if you already have an idea of who you intend to work with, you may indicate it here.

**Team members**:

1. James Doh (dohj0109) - [Primary role]
2. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role]
3. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_
4. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_

**Team status**:
- [ ] Same team from Round 3
- [X] New team formed during Round 4
- [ ] Solo (will find teammates later)
- [ ] Joining an existing team

## 7. Reflection

**Most valuable part of Round 4**:
Seeing how different people reacted instantly to each idea—those reactions showed me which ideas actually excited users.

**Biggest surprise**:
Even projects that seem simple often break down because of incentive or cold-start issues; the hardest part isn't building, it's bootstrapping.

**One thing I'd tell future students about Round 4**:
Focus on who your first 20 users are—not your ideal user base a year from now.

## Commitment

**I commit to**:
- [X] Building the MVP scope above (3-4 features maximum)
- [X] Running a concrete Week 1 validation test
- [X] Pivoting if Week 1 shows <20% success
- [X] Meeting with instructor if I hit major blockers
